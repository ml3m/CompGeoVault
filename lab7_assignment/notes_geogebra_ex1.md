For this polygon:
- n = 12
- cameras required = floor(12 / 3) = 4
- But we can see that by using Red the minimum is actually 3.

### Step 1: Triangulate the Polygon To ensure full coverage, the polygon is
divided into non-overlapping triangles. A polygon with `n` vertices can be
divided into `n - 2` triangles. For this polygon:
- Number of triangles = 12 - 2 = 10

### Step 2: Color the Triangulation Graph The graph formed by the triangulation
can be 3-colored, meaning we can use three colors such that no two adjacent
vertices share the same color. By selecting one color, we can place cameras at
those vertices to cover the entire polygon.

### Step 3: Place the Cameras After coloring the triangulation:
- Assume the chosen color corresponds to vertices 
- Place cameras at these vertices.

### Step 4: Verify Coverage Each triangle from the triangulation has at least
one vertex where a camera is placed. This ensures that the entire polygon is
covered.

## Explanations

### Why floor(n / 3) Cameras? Triangulation divides the polygon into triangles,
and 3-coloring ensures each triangle has at least one vertex of each color. By
selecting one color, every triangle is guaranteed to have a camera at one of
its vertices.

### Why This Placement Works? Cameras placed at vertices can see every point
within the polygon because the interior is fully visible from these vertices,
as ensured by triangulation.

## Conclusion Using the Art Gallery Theorem, a minimum of 3 cameras.
