# Exercise One
## Art Gallery Problem - Symmetrical Polygon

This exercise demonstrates the application of the Art Gallery Theorem for a polygon with symmetric points about the Ox axis.

### Problem Description
Apply the method of the art gallery theorem for a polygon P₁P₂...P₁₂, where:
- P₁ = (4, -4)
- P₂ = (-5, 6)
- P₃ = (6, -4)
- P₄ = (-7, 4)
- P₅ = (9, 6)
- P₆ = (11, 6)
- Points P₇ to P₁₂ are symmetrical points of P₆ to P₁ with respect to the Ox axis

# Exercise Two
## Art Gallery Problem - Multiple Camera Configurations

This exercise explores different camera placement configurations for a specific polygon using the Art Gallery Theorem.

### Problem Description
Consider the polygon P₁P₂P₃P₄P₅P₆, where:

- P₄ = (3, 0)
- P₅ = (1, 2)
- P₆ = (3, 2)

The solution demonstrates:
a. A configuration where one camera is sufficient
b. A configuration where two cameras are necessary and sufficient
