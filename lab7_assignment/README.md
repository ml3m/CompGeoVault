## Exercises Overview

### [Exercise One](exercise_one/README.md)
Application of the Art Gallery Theorem for a symmetric polygon with 12 vertices. Demonstrates camera placement strategy for a complex polygon with symmetrical properties.

### [Exercise Two](exercise_two/README.md)
Exploration of the Art Gallery Theorem with multiple camera configurations, showing both minimal and necessary camera placement scenarios.

### [Exercise Three](exercise_three/README.md)
Construction and analysis of a specific triangulation case featuring 3 triangles and 5 edges, with proof of 3-colorability.

### [Exercise Four](exercise_four/README.md)
Implementation of an 11-edge triangulation for a 7-point set, including visualization and 3-colorability proof.

### [Exercise Five](exercise_five/README.md)
Special case study of a 6-point triangulation with specific subset properties, featuring an animated visualization of the construction process.

## Technologies Used
- Computational Geometry Algorithms
- Python for Visualizations
- Matplotlib for Graphics
