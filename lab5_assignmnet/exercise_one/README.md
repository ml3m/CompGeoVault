# QuickHull Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

QuickHull is an efficient algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of points in a plane. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the given points. This implementation provides a robust and efficient solution for finding the convex hull using a divide-and-conquer approach.

## Algorithm Explanation

The QuickHull algorithm works through the following key steps:

1. **Find Extreme Points**: 
   - Identify the points with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates
   - These points are guaranteed to be part of the convex hull

2. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Divide the point set into two subsets using the line connecting the extreme points
   - Recursively find points that are farthest from this line
   - These farthest points help define the convex hull segments

3. **Recursive Partitioning**:
   - For each subset, find the point farthest from the current line
   - If this point is outside the current hull segment, it becomes a new vertex
   - Recursively process the triangular regions created by this point

## Time Complexity

- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
- Best Case: O(n log n)
## Space Complexity

- O(n) additional space for recursive calls and storing hull points

## Example

### Input Points
Consider the following set of points:
```
Points = [(30, 60), (15, 25), (0, 30), (70, 30), (50, 40), (50, 10), (20, 0), (55, 20)]
```
