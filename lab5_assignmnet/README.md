### Running the Programs in Python

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: The program uses `matplotlib` and `numpy`
   for plotting and animation. 
   ```bash 
   pip install matplotlib numpy 
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: After installing the required libraries, navigate to
   the folder containing the Python script (`program_name.py`) and run it using
   the following command:

   ```bash 
   python program_name.py 
   ```

   This will execute the program and display the animated visualization of the
   convex hull algorithm. If the animation is saved to a file (e.g.,
   `lower_hull_animation.gif`), you can view it from the `outputs` directory.

For any issues or errors, please make sure that you have Python and the
required libraries installed properly.
